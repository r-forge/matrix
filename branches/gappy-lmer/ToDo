-----
Currently lmer does not fill in the disc and bqd slots in the deviance
slot.  Fix this.
-----
Allow for a matrix of responses in lmer so multiple fits can be
performed without needing to regenerate the model matrices.
-----
Modify the one-argument form of the anova method for lmer objects (yet
  again) to calculate the F ratios.  It is the df, not the ratio that
  is controversial.
Should there be an extractor function for the mean square error?  If
  so, what should it be called?
-----
Determine what a "coef" function should do for multiple, possibly
  non-nested, grouping  factors.
-----
Determine why the names of the components of the values of
the ranef and coef extractor methods are not printed.
-----
- add nicer (more realistic?) pedigree examples and tests

- document print(<mer>) including an example  print(<lmer>, corr = FALSE)
