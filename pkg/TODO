- Report the problem in the Linux ldexp manual page.  The second and
  third calls in the Synopsis should be to ldexpf and ldexpl.

- [,] indexing

- group generics: "Arith", but also "Ops" and "Math";  see
  ?Math.data.frame  and the examples in
  ?SetGeneric

- check to see if the .onLoad function to require the methods package
  (in the AllClass.R file) is needed

- Should the uplo and diag slots continue to be stored as character?
  An alternative is to use a factor as in the enum values for the
  cblas.

- Organization of the source code files - right now they are organized
  according to class (e.g. dgeMatrix.R, dgeMatrix.h, dgeMatrix.c).  Is
  there a better way?

- Fix the calculation of the Dim slot for the crossprod method for
  dgCMatrix objects (too tired to do that now).
