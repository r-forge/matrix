- Report the problem in the Linux ldexp manual page.  The second and
  third calls in the Synopsis should be to ldexpf and ldexpl.

- [,] indexing

- group generics: "Arith", but also "Ops" and "Math";  see
  ?Math.data.frame  and the examples in
  ?SetGeneric

- Should the uplo and diag slots continue to be stored as character?
  An alternative is to use a factor as in the enum values for the
  cblas.

- Organization of the source code files - right now they are organized
  according to class (e.g. dgeMatrix.R, dgeMatrix.h, dgeMatrix.c).  Is
  there a better way?

- Fix the calculation of the Dim slot for the crossprod method for
  dgCMatrix objects (too tired to do that now).

- bCrosstab(): do we really want the diagonal "V:V" crosstabs?
	       (if so or in any case: add to  man/bCrosstab.Rd )

- src/Metis/ : one of the two Makefiles needs fixing, as changing
	     src/Metis/*.c  does not lead to recompilation.

- man/Matrix.Rd :  has example with dimnames, but we just drop them!
		MM thinks dimnames should be supported (but then ...)

- data/ : names 'mm' and even more 'y' are  ``too short''.
	If we really want to keep them, don't use "LazyData"
	(such that one needs  data(*) explicitly);
	But MM would rather want something like  ex.mm and ex.y

- spelling style: Should "coersion" be "coercion" ?

-------

We have a (at least one) basic problem :
   Currently the show() method fail sometime after coercion:
   e.g. 'sy' show()s wrongly, even though it "str()" fine :

      (po <- crossprod(Matrix(0:3, 2))) # ok
      (ge <- as(po, "dgeMatrix")) # ok
      (sy <- as(po, "dsyMatrix")) # BAD
      str(sy) # looks fine

  or
      example(expand) # -> ex$L and ex$U look bad, however
      as(ex$L, "dgeMatrix") # `works'

  {Of course, we don't need a workaround but must understand
   and solve the problem}
