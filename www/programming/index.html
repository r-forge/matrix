Programming using the R Matrix Package</h1>

<ol>
<li> In versions of the Matrix package up to (and including) 0.999375-30,
  <<tt>determinant(CF)</tt> where <tt>CF <- Cholesky(A,*)</tt> has been
  computing the  determinant of A, whereas e.g.,  <tt>determinant(chol(A))</tt>
  has always returned the determinant of the Cholesky <em>factor</em> of
  A = RR' = L'L.
  Of course, det(A) = det(L)^2 = det(R)^2, or equivalently
  log(det(A)) = 2 * log(abs(det(L))) = 2 * log(abs(det(R))) which is
  what <tt>determinant()</tt> computes with its default
  setting <tt>logarithm = TRUE</tt>.
  <p>

  This behavior is changed for consistency reasons, from Matrix version
  0.999375-31 on, notably the upcoming Matrix 1.0-0.
  <cr>
  "Once per session" warnings are issued in version 0.999375-30
  (<em>before</em> the change) and 0.999375-31 (<em>after</em> the change),
  possibly also for a few further releases.
  <p>

  Those of you making use of <tt>determinant(Cholesky(.))</tt> are
  <em>strongly</em> advised to make their R code work correctly in older
  and newer versions of <tt>Matrix</tt> with something like the following
<pre>
  .f <- if(package_version(packageDescription("Matrix")$Version) >=
           "0.999375-30") 2 else 1
  ## and use
  .f * determinant(myCholesky)$modulus
</pre>
